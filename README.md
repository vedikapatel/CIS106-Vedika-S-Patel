Currently, I am a District Manager for Dunkin' handling 6 stores for a franchisee. As a manager, I use the POS system on daily basis to ring up orders for my customers. I usually wonder how a touch of a button on the screen shows the price of the product. Due to this reason, I started doing some research behind these systems and how they function. After my research, I came to know that these systems are created by software developers. This made me more curious about the degree that one needs to become a software developer. Upon my investigation and research, I found out that I need to pursue a degree in Computer Science to become a software developer. Due to my willingness to learn more about Computer Science and software development in general, I decided to sign up for a software development certificate at Harper College. As part of that certification, this course is one of the fundamental courses for beginners like me. I am hoping to use this class as the foundation for my software development journey.
